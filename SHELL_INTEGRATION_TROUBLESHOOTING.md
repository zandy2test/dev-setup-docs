# üîß Shell Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See "Shell Integration Unavailable" Again

**DON'T IGNORE IT!** This message indicates a real problem that needs fixing.

---

## üö® **Immediate Impact of This Warning:**
- ‚ùå Cline can't see command output
- ‚ùå Commands might fail silently
- ‚ùå Git operations could have hidden errors
- ‚ùå File operations might not work as expected
- ‚ùå Development becomes unreliable and risky

---

## üîç **Quick Diagnosis Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Current Status**
Run this command in Cline to test if shell integration is working:
```
Write-Host "Shell integration test - you should see this output clearly"
```

**If Cline shows the output clearly:** ‚úÖ Integration is working  
**If Cline says "output could not be captured":** ‚ùå Integration is broken

### **Step 2: Check Terminal Profile**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in VS Code
2. Type "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
3. Make sure **PowerShell** is selected (not Command Prompt or other)

### **Step 3: Restart VS Code Terminal**
1. Close all terminal tabs in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+`` to open a new terminal
3. Test again with the command from Step 1

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fix Procedures (In Order of Likelihood):**

### **Fix 1: Restart VS Code Completely**
1. Close ALL VS Code windows
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open terminal (`Ctrl+``)
4. Test shell integration

**Success Rate:** ~70%

### **Fix 2: Reset Terminal Profile**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
2. Choose **PowerShell**
3. Close and reopen terminal
4. Test shell integration

**Success Rate:** ~20%

### **Fix 3: Check VS Code Settings**
Verify these settings in your VS Code settings.json:
```json
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell",
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": true,
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.showWelcome": false
```

**Success Rate:** ~8%

### **Fix 4: Update VS Code**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Update"
2. Restart VS Code after update
3. Test shell integration

**Success Rate:** ~2%

### **Fix 5: Nuclear Option - Reset All Terminal Settings**
If nothing else works, reset terminal configuration:
1. Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "terminal.integrated"
3. Reset all terminal settings to default
4. Reconfigure using our setup guide

## üéØ **Prevention Tips:**

### **Regular Maintenance:**
- **After VS Code updates:** Always test shell integration
- **After Windows updates:** Check if PowerShell still works
- **Monthly check:** Run a quick shell integration test

### **Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- Commands seem to run but no output visible
- Git operations appear successful but nothing changes
- File creation commands don't show results
- Error messages disappear immediately

---

## üìû **When to Be Concerned:**

### **High Priority (Fix Immediately):**
- Any Git operations (could lose work)
- File creation/modification commands
- Package installations
- Deployment commands

### **Medium Priority (Fix Soon):**
- General development commands
- Testing and debugging
- File system navigation

### **Low Priority (Can Wait):**
- Simple echo commands
- Basic information queries

## üîÑ **Quick Recovery Checklist:**

When you see the warning:

- [ ] **Stop current work** - Don't run important commands
- [ ] **Test shell integration** with simple command
- [ ] **Try Fix 1** (Restart VS Code)
- [ ] **Test again** to confirm fix
- [ ] **If still broken, try Fix 2** (Reset terminal profile)
- [ ] **Continue only when confirmed working**

---

## üí° **Pro Tips:**

### **Early Detection:**
- If commands seem to run but you don't see output, check for the warning
- If Cline says "command executed successfully" but shows no results, investigate

### **Quick Test Command:**
Always use this to test shell integration:
```powershell
Write-Host "Integration test: $(Get-Date)"
```
You should see the current date/time clearly.

### **Backup Plan:**
If shell integration breaks during important work:
- Use VS Code's built-in terminal manually
- Complete critical operations (Git commits, etc.)
- Fix integration before continuing with Cline

---

## üö® **Red Flags - Stop Everything:**

If you see these, **STOP** and fix shell integration immediately:
- "Command output could not be captured" repeatedly
- Git commands seem to work but `git status` shows no changes
- File creation commands run but files don't appear
- Error messages flash and disappear

---

**Remember: Shell integration is critical for reliable AI-assisted development. Always fix it promptly when issues arise!**
