## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Live Server doesn't work:**
- Make sure you have an HTML file open
- Right-click the HTML file in explorer → "Open with Live Server"
- Ensure you're in WSL mode (check bottom-left corner of VS Code)

### **If formatting doesn't work:**
- Check that Prettier is set as default formatter (already configured)
- Save the file (Ctrl+S) to trigger formatting
- Ensure file is in WSL filesystem for best performance

### **If Project Manager is empty:**
- It scans your configured project folders automatically
- Create a new project folder and it will appear
- For WSL projects, ensure proper folder permissions

### **WSL-Specific Issues:**
- **If terminal doesn't open:** Use Ctrl+Shift+P → "WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL"
- **If extensions don't work:** Some extensions need to be installed in WSL specifically
- **If file changes don't sync:** Ensure you're working in WSL filesystem, not Windows mounted drives for best performance
